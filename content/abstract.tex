Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been a popular choice for approximation algorithm design ever since Goemans and Williamson used one to improve the best approximation of \textsc{Max-Cut} in 1995.
In the effort to construct stronger and stronger SDP relaxations, the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) or Lasserre hierarchy has emerged as the premier candidate. 
However, since the SOS hierarchy is relatively new, we still do not know the answer to even very basic questions about its power. 
For example, we do not even know when the SOS SDP is guaranteed to run correctly in polynomial time!

In this dissertation, we study the SOS hierarchy and make positive progress in understanding the above question, among others.
First, we give a sufficient, checkable criteria for when an SOS SDP will run in polynomial time, as well as confirm that our criteria holds for a number of common applications of the SOS SDP. We also present example constraints and a polynomial which has SOS certificates that require $2^{O(\sqrt{n})}$ time to find, even though the certificates are degree two. 

Second, we study the power of the SOS hierarchy relative to other symmetric SDP relaxations of a comparable size. We show that in some situations, the SOS hierarchy achieves the best possible approximation among any such SDP relaxation. In particular, we show that the SOS SDP is optimal for the \textsc{Matching} problem, and this together with an SOS lower bound due to Grigoriev, implies that \textsc{Matching} has no subexponential size SDP relaxations. 

As a key technical tool, our results make use of low-degree certificates of ideal membership for the polynomial ideal formed by the constraints. Thus an important step in our proofs is constructing certificates for arbitrary polynomials in the corresponding constraint ideals. We develop a meta-strategy for when the polynomial constraints exhibit many symmetries. We apply our strategy to get low-degree certificates for \textsc{Matching}, \textsc{Balanced CSP}, \textsc{TSP}, and others.
