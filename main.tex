\begin{acknowledgements}
First I would like to thank my advisor Prasad Raghavendra for the invaluable help and time he has given me over the last five years at UC Berkeley.
He is undoubtedly the person second-most responsible for the creation of this document. 
My stay at Berkeley was not always easy, and I went long periods of time went without achieving results, which ended with me feeling frustrated and hopeless.
Despite this, Prasad was always willing to devote time and talk with me, on subjects both mathematical and otherwise. 
His mind is truly incredible, and I was always amazed by how quickly he could think of new and different approaches to problems we were stuck on. 
Thanks to his assistance, I am now graduating and I am excited for the future. 
Thank you so much, Prasad!

I would also like to thank Chris Umans (also a Berkeley alum), who was one of my favorite professors at Caltech. 
Chris was the first person who showed me what research in Theoretical Computer Science was like, and he helped cultivate my interest in it during my time at Caltech.
He was also a fantastic teacher, and his classes were among the favorites that I have ever taken. 
He is probably third-most responsible for this thesis, as without him I may not have even come to graduate school. 

Thanks are also in order for Satish Rao, Nikhil Srivastava, and Luca Trevisan for serving on both my Qualifying Committee and my Dissertation Committee.
Thank you for taking time out your schedule to listen to me ramble. 

I would also like to thank my many graduate student peers at Berkeley (and one technically from Stanford) for sharing many of the experiences of the past five years with me. 
I would particularly like to thank Jonah Brown-Cohen, Rishi Gupta, Alex Psomas, Aviad Rubinstein, Jarett Schwartz, Ning Tan and Tselil Schramm. 
Each of you has been a great friend to me, and contributed in no small part to my happiness during my time at Berkeley. 
I will miss all of you greatly. 

My girlfriend Irene deserves more than I could possibly write in the small space provided to me. 
You have happily supported me in the pursuit of all of my goals, both academic and otherwise. 
That means everything to me, and I love you very much. I cannot wait to see what the future has in store for us. 

Finally, I want to thank my loving mother, father, and brother. 
Each of you has provided me with plenty of advice when times were tough for me, and it is thanks to you that I was even in the position to begin to attempt this thesis in the first place.
In many respects, you are partly responsible for all of my achievements by raising me. 
Luckily, I think you did a pretty darn good job of it. 
I know I do not call as often as you would like, but know that I love each of you to a large degree.
